# IBM_Machine_Learning
Peer-Graded Assignments for the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate offered via Coursera

This repository contains only the "quick & dirty" code for the assignments plus the document which had to be submitted unless code actually had to be submitted. The code may contain sections that were not used in the paper or presentation written. It may also have been re-run and show slightly different results, especially for machine learning models which did not always use random_state to make the results reproducible.
